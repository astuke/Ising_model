# Ising_model

This code uses simulated annealing to find the ground states of the random bond Ising model on a square lattice. The model consists of discrete variables that represent the magnetic moments of atomic spins that can be either in the state +1 or -1. The spins are arranged in a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbours. The ground state depends on the specific realization of the coupling between neighbouring sites. If the interaction is positive, the energy of the system is minimized when all spins point in the same direction so that the system is ferromagnetic. If the interaction is negative, the energy of the system is minimized when neighbouring spins point in opposite directions. The system is antiferromagnetic.
